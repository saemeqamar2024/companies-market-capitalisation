# Companies Market Capitalisation Project

## Objectives
The main objectives of this analysis were to find out the following information:
- The market capitalisations of the Top 10 companies in the world.
- The total percentage of the number of shares for each market capitalisation category.
- The number of companies, in the Top 500, that belong to different stock price ranges.
- The number of companies that belong to each of the G20 countries.

## Data Understanding
The dataset was originally created on 29th January 2024 on www.companiesmarketcap.com and was subsequently made available on Kaggle. The data was downloaded from Kaggle.
